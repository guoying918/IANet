# IANet: Instance-Aware Feature Learning for Efficient Few-Shot Hyperspectral Image Classification

The source code for our new work on few-shot hyperspectral image classification tasks, which is currently under review at The Multimedia Systems. Once the paper is published, we will make the code publicly available.

If you are a reviewer or researcher and need the code to verify the experimental results in our paper, please feel free to contact us via email: yingguo@mail.nwpu.edu.cn.

If our paper or code is helpful to your research, we would greatly appreciate it if you could cite our work. Thank you very much!
